        <h4>Problem:</h4>
        <p>You have 100 bag of coins. 99 of them are the same weight and the other is a different weight. 
          Could be either heavier or lighter. If you have a scale that can compare as may bags weights as you want at a time, what would your approch be for finding the bag of a different weight in the least amount of times using the scale?</p>
        <br />
         <p>Solution currently a WIP. Flow not yet solved for would be similar though - see github for <a href="https://github.com/kpetski/teasers/blob/master/codeExplinations/fiftyCoins.js">executable example</a> going all the way through one flow.</p>
